** Bugs **

- Transition in the library pix dissolves the picture at the wrong place.
- Transition at the red light at rt9 and brookline ave sometimes thinks
  it should slide left rather than dissolve.
+ Menus don't work right with arrow keys anymore.
- updateView doesn't work in recursive mode
- left180 and right180 should have different transitions
